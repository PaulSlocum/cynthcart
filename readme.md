A synthesizer program for the Commodore 64 computer designed with live performance in mind. Includes arpeggiator, portamento, stereo SID and MIDI support, realtime filter control, many other features.  The program is written in 6510 assembly language.  Over 700 Cynthcart cartridges have been sold making it one of the most popular Commodore 64 homebrews.

## Running The Program

Cartridges are available from [Shareware Plus on Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/tim685?_trksid=p2047675.l2559) and the ROM ([cynthcart2.0.prg](bin/version2.0.0_RELEASE/cynthcart2.0.prg)) can be played on emulators like [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/) or on real Commodore 64 hardware using an [SD2IEC](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SD2IEC) or similar.


## Instruction Manual

The manual is available [here](manual/cynthcart2.0.1.pdf), and there are also supplementary [keyboard reference charts](manual/keyboardReferenceCharts). 


## Building From Source

I use the [DASM assembler](http://dasm-dillon.sourceforge.net/) (old DOS/Win version included) to build the game, and the project also uses [Pucrunch](https://github.com/mist64/pucrunch) to compresses the cartridge ROM image to fit into 8K.  The [makeCynthcart.bat](makeCynthcart.bat) batch file assembles the different versions and creates the compressed cartridge ROM image.

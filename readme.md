# Cynthcart

A synthesizer program for the Commodore 64 computer designed with live performance in mind. Includes arpeggiator, portamento, stereo SID and MIDI support, realtime filter control, many other features.

## Running The Program

Cartridges are available from [Shareware Plus on Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/usr/tim685?_trksid=p2047675.l2559) and the ROM (cynthcart.prg) can be played on VICE andother emulators or on real Commodore 64 hardware using an SD2IEC or similar.


### Building From Source

I use the DASM assembler to build the game, and there is also a program included in the project that compresses the cartridge ROM image to fit into 8K.  More info on assembly coming soon...
